# Image_clustering

pre trained model which used in this code is VGG16 convolutional neural network (CNN) 

**load_img allows us to load an image from a file as a PIL object**



img_to_array allows us to convert the PIL object into a NumPy array
preproccess_input is meant to prepare your image into the format the model requires. You should load images with the Keras load_img function so that you guarantee the images you load are compatible with the preprocess_input function.
VGG16 is the pre-trained model we used
DBSCAN clustering algorithm weâ€™re used
PCA for reducing the dimensions of our feature vector
